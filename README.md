Beautiful plots with ggplot2

Back to Resbaz List of HackMDs

Being able to create visualizations (graphical representations) of data is a key step in being able to communicate information and findings to others. In this module you will learn to use the ggplot2 library to declaratively make beautiful plots or charts of your data. Learning the framework for using this library will allow you to make nearly any kind of (static) data visualization, customized to your exact specifications.
Getting Started

    This workshop expects some working basic knowledge of R, RStudio and if possible of the ‘tidyverse’
    Installations:
        To follow this workshop you’ll need R and Rstudio installed on your computer.
        Open RStudio and install the tidyverse libraries by typing install.packages("tidyverse") in the console.
        You’ll also need the avocado price dataset available here (but we’ll do this together):
            https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices/data

What We’ll Cover

    The ‘layered’ system of adding plot components (geoms)
    The ‘grammar’ of graphics
    Plotting dates in a time series
    Extras: Add an image (or three) to your plot!
    We’ll work as consistently as possible with previous workshops
